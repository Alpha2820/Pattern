# Java Pattern Printing Collection

This repository contains a set of simple Java programs that demonstrate how to print various patterns using loops and basic logic. The code is grouped into three categories: character patterns, number patterns, and star patterns.

## 📁 Directory Structure

- **Character Patterns/**
  - Programs that print patterns using letters (A, B, C, ...).
  - Example: `pattern1.java` prints a triangle of increasing alphabets.

- **Number Patterns/**
  - Programs using digits (1, 2, 3, ...).
  - Each file corresponds to a different pattern (triangles, pyramids, matrices, etc.).

- **Star Patterns/**
  - Patterns made with the asterisk (`*`) character.
  - Common exercises include pyramids, diamond shapes, and right/left aligned triangles.

Each folder contains 12 example programs named `pattern1.java` through `pattern12.java`.

## 🚀 Usage

1. Open any pattern file in your favorite Java IDE or a text editor.
2. Compile using `javac`:
   ```bash
   javac pattern1.java
   ```
3. Run the compiled class and provide an integer input (rows/size) when prompted:
   ```bash
   java pattern1
   ```
4. Observe the printed pattern in the console.

> All programs read a single integer from standard input which controls the size of the pattern.

## 📝 Adding New Patterns

- Copy one of the existing files and update the logic to create a new pattern.
- Maintain the same input strategy (read an integer from `Scanner`).
- Use descriptive comments at the top to indicate what the pattern looks like.

## 📚 Learning Goals

These examples are ideal for beginners learning how to use:

- `for` loops (nested loops)
- `Scanner` for input
- Basic control flow and character/number arithmetic
- Console output formatting with `System.out.print` and `println`

Feel free to explore, modify, and extend these programs as you learn Java!
